# Facebook Messages Parser

This is a script that produces fun graphs from the `messages.htm` file that can be downloaded using [these instructions](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467/).

This script depends on:

  * [`facebook-sdk`](https://github.com/mobolic/facebook-sdk)
  * `numpy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `Beautiful Soup`

You'll also need a Graph API access token, which you can get from [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).
